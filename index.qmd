### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a researcher, engineer, choice modeler, [{{< fa brands r-project >}}](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) developer, musician, swing dancer, and an Assistant Professor at George Washington University in the [Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](http://emse.seas.gwu.edu/). I study technological change with a focus on accelerating the transition to low-carbon technologies like electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.
